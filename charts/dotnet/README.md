## Install Chart

## Uninstall Chart

```console
# Helm
$ helm uninstall [RELEASE_NAME]

This removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Upgrading Chart

```

With Helm v3, CRDs created by this chart are not updated by default and should be manually updated.
Consult also the [Helm Documentation on CRDs](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/custom_resource_definitions).

_See [helm upgrade](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/) for command documentation._

### Upgrading an existing Release to a new major version

A major chart version change (like v1.2.3 -> v2.0.0) indicates that there is an incompatible breaking change needing manual actions.

### From 1.x to 2.x

This has not happened yet; so a placeholder will exist here until then.

## Configuration

See [Customizing the Chart Before Installing](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#customizing-the-chart-before-installing). To see all configurable options with detailed comments:

```console
helm show values fluidtruck/kube-prometheus-stack
```

You may also `helm show values` on this chart's [dependencies](#dependencies) for additional options.
